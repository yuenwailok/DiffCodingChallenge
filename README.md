# DiffCodingChallenge

# App instruction:
enter the lease id in order to generate the payments: Id must be shorter than 8 and must not include symbols or any non-digits and non-letter character.

Please open different-coding-test.html in order to run the Apps. Two files: lease-payment.js and recordtest.js must be included.

# Test suites:
The recordtest.test.js file contains test cases for lease-paymentclone.js file (tests for how to generate the payment list)
The leasepayment.test.js file contains test cases for recordtestclone1.js (tests for react component)
Because the broswer cannot run node.js code, I've cloned the lease-payment.js and recordtest.js files, which is lease-paymentclone.js and recordtestclone1.js
